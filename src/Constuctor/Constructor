// Constructor

which initilizes the object.
its same name as class name
it does not have a return type, not even void
look similar to method.

Student st = new Student();

Two type of Const.
1.default const - no parameter // it actually gives you default value i.e if you didn't declare any value,
then default const automatically assign default value like for int 0;

public Student(){
}

2.Parameterized - with parameters
public student (String name, String email, String course){
this.name = name;
this.email = email;
}

## Rules
1. default const is present for all the classes by default
2. if there is a parameterized const, JVM will not create a default const
3. if you need a default const, then you have to create in case of presence of parameterize const.

Student.java -------> Student.class [Byte code] // behind the scene .java file converted to
.class file which is machine dependent(byte code). It will be read by JVM(java virtual machine)


// in case, if there is no constructor, then at compile time java automatically
// create a default constructor

//Compiler ----check for any syntax,error, not logical, parameters, each and everything
before running and this code is machine independent.

Step 1:
Javac Student.java //java compiler  // It converted to .class

Step2:run the code

java student


## Keywords in Java?
In the Java programming language, a keyword is any one of 68 reserved words that have a predefined meaning in the language.
Because of this, programmers cannot use keywords in some contexts, such as names for variables,methods, classes, or as any
 other identifier.

## this // keyword
1. refers to the current object
--- > it refers to the current class instance variable

2. this() -constructor chaining
calling one constructor from another constructor

##variables
1. instance variable // belong to class, they have scope inside that class
2. local variable // i.e  public Employee (String myVariable)
 {
 this.id = myVariable;
 }
 // local variable, has scope inside  method only, we can't access outside
3. static variable

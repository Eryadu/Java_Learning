// MethodOverloading
One method perform different function with different input but under same name.

it just behave differently on different input but do not change behave that's
why overloading is used.

example:

static void Sum(int x, int y){// parameters

        int z = x+y;
        System.out.println("Sum of Numbers " + z);
    }

    static void Sum(int x, int y, int z){// parameters

            int z1 = x+y+z;
            System.out.println("Sum of Numbers " + z);
        }

        its behaviour is same as addition but behave differently with different inputs.
